# 🕳️ CryptoCave

**CryptoCave** is my personal journey into the depths of cryptography — a cave where secrets are forged, broken, and rebuilt. From ancient ciphers to modern cryptographic protocols, this is where I explore the theory and practice behind secure communication.

This repo serves as a vault of experiments, notes, and implementations as I work through the craft of cryptography.

## 🧭 What You'll Find Inside

- 🧩 **Secret Sharing** (Shamir, additive, verifiable, PVSS)
- 🧠 **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** & **MPC-in-the-Head**
- 🔐 **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**
- 🏛️ **Classical Cryptography** and cipher analysis
- 🧮 **Modern Primitives** (AES, RSA, ECC, BLS)
- 🔏 **Threshold Signatures** and key management
- 🌌 **Post-Quantum Cryptography** experiments
- 🧨 **Cryptanalysis** of toy and real-world protocols

## 🗂️ Structure

Each folder in the cave is themed around a cryptographic concept or protocol:
- 🧪 Code (Python, Rust, or other languages)
- 📚 Notes with math, diagrams, and intuition
- 🔗 References to papers, standards, and books

## 🧠 Philosophy

I believe true understanding comes from building and breaking. CryptoCave is where I chip away at complex ideas with curiosity, humility, and hands-on exploration.

## 🤝 Collaboration

Feel free to fork, explore, or open an issue. If you're wandering a similar path through cryptography, I'd love to connect and exchange ideas.
