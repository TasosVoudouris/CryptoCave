# 🕳️ CryptoCave

**CryptoCave** is my personal journey into the depths of cryptography — a cave where secrets are forged, broken, and rebuilt. From ancient ciphers to modern cryptographic protocols, this is where I explore the theory and practice behind secure communication.

This repo serves as a vault of experiments, notes, and implementations as I work through the craft of cryptography.

## What You'll Find Inside

- **Secret Sharing** (Shamir, additive, verifiable, PVSS)
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** & **MPC-in-the-Head**
- **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**
- **Classical Cryptography** and cipher analysis
- **Modern Primitives** (AES, RSA, ECC, BLS)
- **Threshold Signatures** and key management
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography** experiments
- **Cryptanalysis** of toy and real-world protocols

## 🗂Structure

Each folder in the cave is themed around a cryptographic concept or protocol:
- Code (Python, Sagemath, and hopefully Rust and other languages in the future)
- Notes with math, diagrams, and intuition
- References to papers, standards, and books

## Philosophy

I believe true understanding comes from building and breaking. CryptoCave is where I chip away at complex ideas with curiosity, humility, and hands-on exploration.

## Collaboration

Feel free to fork, explore, or open an issue. If you're wandering a similar path through cryptography, I'd love to connect and exchange ideas.
