Now that we have learned the basic functions that we will use throughout our journey into cryptographic engineering, let's move on to operations between numbers. 

We will begin with a fundamental operation called **XOR**. Later, we will explore how XOR relates to **modular arithmetic**, but first, we will introduce it in a more intuitive way. Additionally, we will cover other logical operations such as **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT**, which are crucial in cryptography and computer science.

## XOR (Exclusive OR) Operation  

The XOR (Exclusive OR) operation is a fundamental logical operation used extensively in cryptography. It follows these simple rules:

- If two bits are **different**, the result is `1`.
- If two bits are **the same**, the result is `0`.

| A | B | A ‚äï B |
|:-:|:-:|:-----:|
| 0 | 0 |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |   1   |
| 1 | 0 |   1   |
| 1 | 1 |   0   |


### Example in Python:

```python
### XOR OPERATION ###
a = 143 
b = 218 
print(f'{a} XOR {b} = {a ^ b}')   # 143 XOR 218 = 85 
##################### 
```

### Explanation:
- `143` in binary: `10001111`
- `218` in binary: `11011010`
- XOR operation:  
```
  10001111
  11011010
  --------
  01010101  (which is 85 in decimal)
```

## Other Logical Gates

Besides XOR, we frequently use **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** operations in cryptographic applications.

### AND Operation (Logical Conjunction)
- The result is `1` only if **both bits** are `1`, otherwise, it is `0`.

| A | B | A ‚àß B |
|:-:|:-:|:-----:|
| 0 | 0 |  0   |
| 0 | 1 |  0   |
| 1 | 0 |  0   |
| 1 | 1 |  1   |

#### Example in Python:
```python
a = 143
b = 218
print(f'{a} AND {b} = {a & b}')
```

---

### OR Operation (Logical Disjunction)
- The result is `1` if **at least one bit** is `1`.

| A | B | A ‚à® B |
|:-:|:-:|:-----:|
| 0 | 0 |  0   |
| 0 | 1 |  1   |
| 1 | 0 |  1   |
| 1 | 1 |  1   |

#### Example in Python:
```python
a = 143
b = 218
print(f'{a} OR {b} = {a | b}')
```

---

### NOT Operation (Bitwise Negation)
- The NOT operation flips all bits (`1` becomes `0`, and `0` becomes `1`).

| A | ¬¨A |
|---|----|
| 0 |  1 |
| 1 |  0 |

#### Example in Python:
```python
a = 143
print(f'NOT {a} = {~a}') 
```
(Note: Python represents negative numbers in two's complement notation.)

---

## `pow()` & MOD Operator  

The `pow()` function in Python is used for **modular exponentiation**, an operation that appears frequently in cryptography ‚Äî especially in algorithms like **RSA**, **Diffie-Hellman**, and **ElGamal**. It efficiently computes:

$$
\text{pow}(x, y, m) = (x^y) \mod m
$$

This means: raise `x` to the power of `y`, then take the result modulo `m`.

---

### üß† But Why Are We Mentioning This Now?

It might feel a bit early to introduce modular exponentiation ‚Äî we haven‚Äôt fully explored **number theory**, **modular arithmetic**, or **cryptographic protocols** where this becomes crucial. Don‚Äôt worry! We‚Äôll cover all of that in the coming days.

We‚Äôre including it here as a **preview** of one of cryptography‚Äôs most important operations, and because it begins to show how computers **‚Äúwrap around‚Äù numbers** ‚Äî an idea that also exists in **bitwise operations** like XOR.

> üí° Think of **XOR** (in binary) as a kind of *modular addition*, where `1 + 1 = 0` (mod 2). While it operates on bits, and `pow()` on numbers, both use the idea of working **within a fixed range** ‚Äî wrapping around instead of overflowing.

So while XOR and `pow()` look unrelated, they both touch the core cryptographic concept of **controlled operations within limited numeric domains** ‚Äî one on bits, the other on integers modulo `m`.

---

### Example:
```python
### pow() & MOD OPERATOR (%) ###
print(pow(3, 4, 15))  # (3^4) % 15 = 81 % 15 = 6
################################ 
```
This computes:

- $3^4 = 81$  
- $81 \mod 15 = 6$

We‚Äôll see a lot more of this when diving into **modular arithmetic**, **prime numbers**, and **public-key cryptography**


---

## `os.urandom()` for Random Bytes  
In cryptography, randomness is a fundamental requirement ‚Äî it's used to generate secure keys, nonces, and IVs (Initialization Vectors). If some of these terms are unfamiliar, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî we‚Äôll explore them in upcoming days in detail. 

For now, we simply want to highlight the `os.urandom()` function, which is one way to generate **cryptographically secure random bytes** in Python. As we progress, we‚Äôll examine other methods for generating randomness and discuss how randomness is actually achieved and assessed in cryptographic systems.



### Example:
```python
### os.urandom() ###
import os 
b = os.urandom(8) 
print(b.hex())  # Random hex bytes
#################### 
```

This generates **8 random bytes** and converts them to a hexadecimal representation.

## Understanding Base64 Encoding

### How Are Images Transmitted Over the Web?

When creating a website, images can be embedded directly into HTML using **Base64 encoding**. This method converts binary data (like images) into an ASCII string, allowing it to be included inline in web pages and transmitted without needing separate image files.

### Example ‚Äì Embedding an Image in HTML with Base64:

```html
<img src="data:image/jpg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEArwBHAAD/2wBDAAYEBAUEBAYFBQUGBgYHCQ4JCQgICRINDQoOFRIWFhUSFBQX">
```
This `src` attribute embeds the image using Base64, storing it as a text-based format.


### üêç Generating a Base64 String in Python
Python provides built-in support for Base64 encoding through the base64 module. You can use it to encode files like images or strings.

### Example ‚Äì Encode an Image to Base64:
```python
import base64

# Read image file in binary mode
with open("example.jpg", "rb") as image_file:
    encoded_image = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

# Print a preview of the encoded string
print(encoded_image[:100] + "...")
# Output: A long Base64 string representing the image, e.g.,
# /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQ... (this is the image data in ASCII format)
```

## Why Is It Called Base64?

The term **Base64** comes from the fact that it uses a character set of **64 unique characters** to represent binary data. To understand this, let's compare it with other number systems:

### **Base10 (Decimal)**
The **decimal system** consists of 10 digits:
```
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
```
We use these digits in everyday numbers.

### **Base16 (Hexadecimal)**
The **hexadecimal system** consists of 16 symbols:
```
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
```
It is commonly used in computing, such as representing colors and memory addresses.

### **Base64 Alphabet**
The **Base64 system** consists of **64 characters**, including:
- **26** uppercase English letters: `A-Z`
- **26** lowercase English letters: `a-z`
- **10** digits: `0-9`
- **2 special symbols**: `+` and `/`

Each character represents **6 bits** of data, making it an efficient way to encode binary data in a textual format.

## Base64 Encoding in Python

Python provides built-in support for **Base64 encoding** through the `base64` module.

### **Encoding a String**
```python
import base64

# Original text
text = "Hello, Base64!"

# Encoding the text
encoded_text = base64.b64encode(text.encode('utf-8'))

# Display encoded result
print(encoded_text.decode('utf-8'))
```
#### **Output:**
```
SGVsbG8sIEJhc2U2NCE=
```
---

### **Decoding a Base64 String**
```python
import base64

# Base64 encoded text
encoded_text = "SGVsbG8sIEJhc2U2NCE="

# Decoding
decoded_text = base64.b64decode(encoded_text).decode('utf-8')

# Display decoded result
print(decoded_text)
```
#### **Output:**
```
Hello, Base64!
```
---

### **Encoding an Image to Base64**
Base64 encoding is often used to embed images into text-based formats.

```python
import base64

# Read image file in binary mode
with open("example.jpg", "rb") as image_file:
    encoded_image = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

# Display a snippet of the encoded image data
print(encoded_image[:100] + "...")
```
This will output a **long Base64 string** representing the image.
